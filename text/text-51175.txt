In today's blog post, we will be discussing the EXO X7 Ranger Plus, a high-end camera drone designed for adults. This drone offers a range of impressive features that make it both powerful and playful.

One of the standout features of the EXO X7 Ranger Plus is its 360° collision avoidance system.

This allows them to focus more on flying and capturing stunning aerial shots.

Speaking of capturing shots, the EXO X7 Ranger Plus comes equipped with a 2K video camera and a 1/3in camera sensor. This combination ensures that users can capture their best moments in impressive quality. Additionally, the drone features a 3-axis gimbal, which helps stabilize the camera and eliminate any unwanted vibrations or shakiness in the footage.

The camera on the EXO X7 Ranger Plus also offers a range of adjustable settings. Users can adjust the camera from a bird's-eye view all the way through skyline shots. They can even zoom in up to 50X digitally, all controlled through the accompanying app. This level of control allows users to capture unique and dynamic shots from various perspectives.

Operating the EXO X7 Ranger Plus is a breeze thanks to its smart features and user-friendly interface. Users can easily access GPS location, virtual reality goggles, and much more through the app. The drone also offers sport mode, which allows it to reach speeds of up to 27MPH. With precise turning and smooth joystick control, users can navigate the drone with ease.

One of the standout features of the EXO X7 Ranger Plus is its ability to follow the user. Users can draw a box around themselves, and the drone will follow, keeping them centered the whole time. Alternatively, users can keep the remote with them, and the drone will follow via its signal. This feature is perfect for capturing action shots or creating dynamic videos.

For those who prefer a more hands-off approach, the EXO X7 Ranger Plus can also fly pre-determined routes. Users can set GPS points on their phone, and the drone will fly the route accordingly. When it's time to return, users can simply tap the "Return to Home" button, and the drone will automatically return and land at the takeoff point. This safety feature ensures that users never have to worry about losing their drone or running out of battery.

In terms of pricing, the EXO X7 Ranger Plus is competitively priced at $549. This includes two batteries, allowing for extended flight time. However, if users are looking for additional features, there are other models available, such as the Mini Pro, Blackhawk 2 Pro, and Cinemaster 2, each with their own unique features and price points.

Customer reviews and ratings are an important aspect to consider when purchasing a product, and the EXO X7 Ranger Plus is no exception.

Exo Drones is a rapidly growing drone company that aims to fill the gap in the market between cheap drones and DJI's collection. The company was established around the same time DJI was added to the US Entity List due to concerns about data privacy. Exo Drones prides itself on not selling customer data and focuses on providing affordable, high-quality drones.

The CEO of Exo Drones, Charlie Canon, started the company after experiencing frustration with expensive DJI drones that had connectivity issues and lacked customer support. The mission of Exo Drones is to offer great customer service and bridge the gap in the drone market.

Exo Drones partnered with Hubsan, a drone manufacturer known for its hardware but lacking in software and customer support. This partnership allows Exo Drones to provide Hubsan with US backing and improve their customer support. Exo Drones later got acquired by OpenStore in August 2022.

One of Exo Drones' popular models is the Exo Mini Pro, which is comparable to DJI's Mini 3 Pro. The Exo Mini Pro offers an adjustable aperture, a feature usually found in professional photography drones. It also connects via USB, which makes it quicker to set up compared to DJI drones that use Wi-Fi. The Exo Mini Pro has obstacle avoidance and a 1/1.26" sensor, making it an improvement over DJI's Mini SE and Mini 2.

The Exo X7 Ranger Plus is another popular model from Exo Drones. It is priced around $300 and is comparable to drones like the HS720E, Ruko F11 Pro, and DJI Mini SE. The standout feature of the Exo X7 Ranger Plus is its 3 axial gimbal, which provides excellent image stability. It also has 4K resolution and similar flight times to other drones in its price range.

The Blackhawk 2 is a drone from Exo Drones that resembles the DJI Mavic Air in design but offers better specs. It has an 8km range, 4K video capabilities, and a 35-minute flight time per battery. However, some users have reported issues with the gimbal, affecting stability during hyper-lapse shots. The Blackhawk 2 also has a less robust GPS system compared to DJI drones.

Exo Drones' partnership with Hubsan has led to speculation that the Blackhawk 2 is just a rebranded Hubsan Zero with a different design. The Hubsan Zino 2 is significantly cheaper than the Blackhawk 2 but offers similar features, such as 4K stills. The Blackhawk 2 has more intelligent flight modes than the Hubsan Zino 2.

Overall, Exo Drones is an exciting competitor in the drone market, offering affordable options with high-quality features. While DJI remains a dominant player, Exo Drones provides an alternative for those looking for a cheaper option. The company continues to improve and release new models, and it will be interesting to see what they offer in the future.

In this text, the author discusses their experience with the Exo x7 drone and warns others against purchasing it. They mention that they did extensive research before buying the drone, including checking multiple sources and forums, but did not find any negative reviews. The marketing technique used by Exo is to claim that their drone has the same technology as DJI drones but at a much lower price. However, the author disagrees with this claim, stating that the videos and pictures they saw in the marketing materials were completely different from what they experienced with their own drone. They describe the quality as barely decent and pixelated, even though the drone is advertised as having 4K video capabilities. The author believes that the Exo x7 is a rebranded Beast drone that is marked up in price. They strongly advise against buying this drone and suggest saving up for a DJI Mini instead.

The author's negative review of the Exo x7 drone is supported by other commenters on the forum. One commenter, Ivan Vanko, disagrees with the author's assessment and claims to have had a positive experience with their Exo drones. They express their preference for Exo drones over DJI drones, citing issues with DJI's customer service and flyaways. Another commenter warns people not to buy the Exo drone, claiming that it is falsely marketed as being manufactured in America when it is actually made in China and India. They criticize Exo for buying and rebranding the drone instead of creating it themselves.

Several other commenters express their gratitude for the honest review and share their own experiences or concerns about the Exo drone. One commenter mentions that they were considering buying the Exo x7 but decided against it after watching YouTube videos from TDR Bikes and Exo themselves. Another commenter asks about the origin of the rebranded drone, to which another commenter replies that it is likely the CSJ x7. Others thank the author for their input and mention that they almost purchased the Exo drone but decided to do more research before making a decision.

The author of the text shares their personal experience with the Exo x7 Ranger Plus drone. They ordered it but received the wrong color, which they consider a minor issue. However, when they tried to use the drone, they encountered problems with the controller. After spending 1.5 hours chatting with customer service, they were promised a new controller, which took an additional 4 days to arrive. The replacement controller was heavily used and did not resemble the original controller. It required AA batteries and was also non-functional. Frustrated with the poor quality and customer service, the author requested a return but had not received approval after 48 hours. They express their disappointment with ExoTech's marketing claims and customer service, comparing it unfavorably to the quick delivery and easy replacement options offered by Amazon for the DJI Mini 2.

The text also includes unrelated information about various subreddits and forums discussing drones, video games, and other topics. These details are not relevant to the main topic of the Exo drone and can be disregarded in the summary.

In conclusion, the author strongly advises against purchasing the Exo x7 drone based on their personal experience and the negative reviews they found. They believe that the marketing claims made by Exo are misleading and that the drone does not live up to its advertised specifications. They suggest saving up for a DJI Mini instead. Other commenters share similar concerns and experiences, expressing gratitude for the honest review and warning others about the potential issues with the Exo drone.
