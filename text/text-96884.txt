In this blog post, we will be discussing the GoPro drone, specifically the HERO10 Black Bones model. This drone is designed for FPV (First Person View) flying and offers impressive features and capabilities.

The HERO10 Black Bones is a lightweight and powerful camera that weighs only 54g. It is equipped with a 5.3K video resolution and Emmy award-winning HyperSmooth 4.0 stabilization, ensuring smooth and high-quality footage. The camera uses the same image sensor and processor as the HERO10 Black, providing lightning-fast performance and stunning imagery.

One of the standout features of the HERO10 Black Bones is the Player + ReelSteady desktop app, which delivers advanced stabilization beyond what is already offered by HyperSmooth 4.0. This app utilizes video metadata to provide flawless stabilization on any shot, giving drone pilots the level of performance they demand.

The HERO10 Black Bones offers various FPV video modes, including 5.3K Wide, 5.3K SuperView, 5K (4:3) Wide, 4K Wide, 4K (4:3) Wide, 2.7K (4:3) Wide, and 2.7K Wide. These modes allow users to capture stunning footage from different perspectives and angles.

Controlling the camera is easy with multiple options available. Users can use the onboard buttons, the Quik App, the Remote, QR codes, or their drone transmitter to control the camera and adjust settings.

The camera features a removable lens cover, a microphone, LED indicators, a shutter button, a mode button, a mounting point, a power connector, and an SD card slot. It also comes with detachable mounting fingers and a mounting screw for easy installation on a drone.

It is important to note that the HERO10 Black Bones is not waterproof or water-resistant, so it should not be used in situations where it could get submerged or exposed to rain or snow. Additionally, it is specifically designed for use with FPV drones and its performance runtime depends on the drone manufacturer and battery used.

Customers who purchase the HERO10 Black Bones also receive several benefits, including unlimited cloud backup and auto uploads, unlimited use of the Quik app, up to 50% off at GoPro.com, and a no-questions-asked camera replacement policy. These perks enhance the overall user experience and provide added value to customers.

Overall, the GoPro HERO10 Black Bones is a top-of-the-line FPV camera that offers exceptional image quality, advanced stabilization technology, and a lightweight design. It is the ultimate choice for drone enthusiasts who want to capture immersive and high-quality footage. With its impressive features and benefits, it is clear why the HERO10 Black Bones is the go-to camera for FPV flying.

In the world of drone photography and videography, having the right camera is essential to capturing stunning footage. GoPro has long been a trusted brand in this field, and their latest offering, the GoPro HERO10 Black Bones, is specifically designed to be the best FPV (first person view) drone camera on the market.

The HERO10 Black Bones boasts all the features that GoPro is known for, including high resolution, small size, and built-in image stabilization. However, what sets it apart is its lightweight design, making it the lightest GoPro camera available. This makes it ideal for use with 3-inch and larger FPV drones. The camera can be easily mounted on standard drones with a single screw boss and comes with an optional adapter for the GoPro mounting system. It also utilizes a standard FPV connector, allowing for quick setup and compatibility with any existing drone battery fitting spec.

One of the standout features of the HERO10 Black Bones is its ability to provide all the same ProTune settings as any GoPro camera. This includes options for adjusting bitrate, shutter speed, ISO, white balance, sharpness, resolution, and frame rate. While the camera does not have an LCD screen, these settings can be easily changed using the Quik App. Additionally, the camera can be controlled in multiple ways, including through the Quik App, a drone transmitter, onboard buttons, and the recently introduced GoPro Labs tech. This tech allows users to point the lens at a QR code to trigger the camera to implement preferred settings.

When it comes to editing and sharing footage, GoPro has made it easy with their Quik App. Users can quickly edit and share their footage on the spot or shortly after capturing it. For those looking for even more advanced editing capabilities, the GoPro Player + ReelSteady desktop application is available. This application allows users to achieve stable and cinematic footage with the power of ReelSteady's Emmy Award-winning stabilization technology.

While the HERO10 Black Bones is an impressive camera on its own, there are a few key accessories that can take drone footage to the next level. The Max Lens Mod, for example, instantly maximizes the field of view and stabilization with Max HyperSmooth and an ultra-wide 155 FOV lens. For those looking to achieve a more cinematic look, the PolarPro Shutter Collection offers protective lenses that reduce shutter speed to cinematic levels, allowing for shooting in various bright light conditions.

In addition to the camera and accessories, GoPro offers a subscription service that provides users with a range of benefits. Subscribers can save $100 on their purchase of the HERO10 Black Bones, receive up to 50% off accessories at GoPro.com, enjoy camera replacement without any questions asked, and take advantage of unlimited cloud backup and auto uploads to keep their footage safe. The subscription also includes the ability for the camera to automatically upload footage when it recognizes a Wi-Fi connection, making it easy to create highlight reels and share them directly from a smartphone.

Overall, the GoPro HERO10 Black Bones is a game-changer for FPV drone photography and videography. Its lightweight design, built-in image stabilization, and compatibility with a range of accessories make it the ideal camera for capturing stunning footage from the sky. Whether you're an experienced FPV pilot or just starting out, the HERO10 Black Bones is sure to take your drone footage to new heights.

In this blog post, we will explore the current state of GoPro drones in the market and discuss why they are slowly being phased out. While there are no newly released GoPro drones, there are still some options available that can be used with a GoPro camera. One such option is the Force F100, which can be found under various brand names. The advantage of using a GoPro camera with this drone is that it can potentially turn it into a better camera drone than others in its price range. However, it is important to note that standard camera drones have evolved significantly in recent years and now offer better camera quality than a GoPro. 

When comparing the advantages and disadvantages of using a drone with a GoPro versus a standard camera drone, it becomes clear that there are more disadvantages to using a GoPro drone. However, there is an exception to this rule where it may be more worthwhile to use a GoPro with a drone rather than purchasing a separate camera drone. 

The MJX Bugs 3 is recommended as the top drone for using with a GoPro. It is priced under $100 and features brushless motors, which make it powerful enough to fly a GoPro. While it lacks GPS and a gimbal, it is a solid option for beginners. Another option is the GoPro Karma, which is no longer in production but can still be found second-hand. It offers a foldable design, a 3-axis gimbal, and a live feed directly from the GoPro camera. However, it faced strong competition from DJI and had some issues with disconnection. 

The only GPS GoPro drone with a gimbal currently available is quite expensive and comparable in price to the DJI Mavic Air 2, which is a superior drone in terms of features and performance. 

There are mounts available for DJI Mavic drones that allow for the attachment of a GoPro camera. However, it is important to consider the added weight and potential impact on battery life. Additionally, other action cameras can also be mounted on drones, such as 360 cameras, which offer a unique perspective. 

Using a GoPro or any action camera on an FPV racing drone is a popular combination, as gimbals are too sensitive to crashes and sudden movements. 

It is possible to have both a GoPro and the drone's camera record simultaneously by using a GoPro mount on a drone like the DJI Mavic series. This can provide different perspectives and serve as backup footage. 

While GoPro drones are not the best option for those seeking a solid or portable quadcopter, there are still some options available that may meet specific needs. However, in most cases, it is recommended to choose a standard camera drone instead. 

In conclusion, the market for GoPro drones has diminished, with no new releases in recent years. While there are still some options available, standard camera drones now offer better camera quality and features. It is important to carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages before deciding to use a GoPro with a drone.

Drones and GoPros have become increasingly popular in recent years, and the compatibility between the two has created a lucrative market. In this article, we will explore a list of drones that are best suited for use with GoPro cameras. The list includes two budget drones, two mid-level drones, and two high-end models.

Starting with the budget options, the Blackhawk drone is designed specifically for use with GoPro cameras and is priced under $100. It is durable and easy to fly, making it a great option for beginners. The drone supports all GoPro Hero models and has a flight time of 15 minutes with a range of 1,200 feet.

Moving on to the mid-level drones, the HS700 is equipped with a built-in camera and is suitable for both beginners and intermediate pilots. It supports GoPro Hero 2, Hero 3, and Hero 4 models and has a flight time of 22 minutes with a range of 3,300 feet. The DROCON Blue Bugs 3 is another mid-level option that is highly regarded for its value. It is compatible with all GoPro Hero models and offers many flight functions found in high-end models. The drone has a flight time of 20 minutes and a range of 1,000 feet.

For pilots in search of mid-budget drones, the AEE AP9 is a durable and sturdy option. It offers multiple flight modes to enhance photo and video quality and has a flight time of 25 minutes with a range of 1,600 feet. It supports GoPro Hero 3, Hero 4, and Hero 4 Session models. Another option in this category is the DJI model, which requires an extra mount for the GoPro. It has a fast charging time, a long flight time of 25 minutes, and a range of 3,300 feet. This drone is considered professional-grade and customizable for video needs.

When choosing a drone for GoPro use, it is important to consider certain factors. Most drones used for photography and videography have horizontal propellers for hovering and slow movement. Some drones have built-in cameras, while others can be equipped with a GoPro using an extra mounting system. It is crucial to ensure that the chosen drone is compatible with the specific GoPro model. Additionally, the method of data sharing, flight time, range, and weight capacity should be taken into account.

Drones with GoPro mounts offer a cost-effective way to achieve professional-quality aerial photography and videography. They can be used for content creation, inspections, and cartography-related purposes. Mastering the piloting and photography skills takes time, but the end result can be high-quality videos and photos.

In conclusion, the compatibility between drones and GoPros has opened up new possibilities for aerial photography and videography. The list of drones provided in this article offers options for different budgets and skill levels. Whether you are a beginner or an aspiring professional, there is a drone that can suit your needs and help you capture stunning footage with your GoPro camera.
