In today's blog post, we will be discussing the EXO X7 Ranger Plus, a high-end camera drone designed for adults. This drone offers a range of impressive features that make it both powerful and playful.

One of the standout features of the EXO X7 Ranger Plus is its 360° collision avoidance system. By snapping on the EXO laser obstacle avoider, users can venture safely without having to constantly worry about their surroundings. This allows them to focus more on flying and capturing stunning aerial shots.

Speaking of capturing shots, the EXO X7 Ranger Plus comes equipped with a 2K video camera and a 1/3in camera sensor. This combination ensures that users can capture their best moments in impressive quality. Additionally, the drone features a 3-axis gimbal, which helps stabilize the camera and eliminate any unwanted vibrations or shakiness in the footage.

The camera on the EXO X7 Ranger Plus also offers a range of adjustable settings. Users can adjust the camera from a bird's-eye view all the way through skyline shots. They can even zoom in up to 50X digitally, all controlled through the accompanying app. This level of control allows users to capture unique and dynamic shots from various perspectives.

Operating the EXO X7 Ranger Plus is a breeze thanks to its smart features and user-friendly interface. Users can easily access GPS location, virtual reality goggles, and much more through the app. The drone also offers sport mode, which allows it to reach speeds of up to 27MPH. With precise turning and smooth joystick control, users can navigate the drone with ease.

One of the standout features of the EXO X7 Ranger Plus is its ability to follow the user. Users can draw a box around themselves, and the drone will follow, keeping them centered the whole time. Alternatively, users can keep the remote with them, and the drone will follow via its signal. This feature is perfect for capturing action shots or creating dynamic videos.

For those who prefer a more hands-off approach, the EXO X7 Ranger Plus can also fly pre-determined routes. Users can set GPS points on their phone, and the drone will fly the route accordingly. When it's time to return, users can simply tap "Return to Home," and the drone will automatically return and land at the takeoff point. This safety auto return feature ensures that users never have to worry about losing their drone.

In terms of pricing, the EXO X7 Ranger Plus is competitively priced at $549. This includes two batteries, allowing for extended flight time. The drone is available in a sleek USA Red color, adding a touch of style to its already impressive features.

Customer reviews and star ratings are an important aspect to consider when purchasing a product. While we don't have access to specific customer reviews for the EXO X7 Ranger Plus, it's worth noting that customer feedback can provide valuable insights into the product's performance and reliability. It's always a good idea to read through reviews and consider the overall star rating before making a purchase.

In conclusion, the EXO X7 Ranger Plus is a high-end camera drone that offers a range of impressive features.

Whether you're an experienced drone pilot or a beginner looking to explore aerial photography, the EXO X7 Ranger Plus is definitely worth considering.

Exo Drones is a rapidly growing drone company that aims to fill the gap in the market between cheap drones and DJI's collection. The company was established around the same time DJI was added to the US Entity List due to concerns about data privacy. Exo Drones prides itself on not selling customer data and focuses on providing affordable, high-quality drones.

The CEO of Exo Drones, Charlie Canon, started the company after experiencing frustration with expensive DJI drones that had connectivity issues and lacked customer support. The mission of Exo Drones is to offer great customer service and bridge the gap in the drone market.

Exo Drones partnered with Hubsan, a drone manufacturer known for its hardware but lacking in software and customer support. This partnership allows Exo Drones to provide Hubsan with US backing and improve their customer support. Exo Drones later got acquired by OpenStore in August 2022.

One of Exo Drones' popular models is the Exo Mini Pro, which is comparable to DJI's Mini 3 Pro. The Exo Mini Pro offers an adjustable aperture, a feature usually found in professional photography drones. It also connects via USB, which makes it quicker to set up compared to DJI drones that use Wi-Fi. The Exo Mini Pro has obstacle avoidance and a 1/1.26" sensor, making it a competitive option in its price range.

The Exo X7 Ranger Plus is another popular model from Exo Drones. It is comparable to drones like the HS720E, Ruko F11 Pro, and DJI Mini SE. The standout feature of the Exo X7 Ranger Plus is its 3 axial gimbal, which provides excellent image stability. It is priced affordably and offers 4K resolution and similar flight times to its competitors.

The Blackhawk 2 is a drone from Exo Drones that resembles the DJI Mavic Air in design but with better specifications. It offers features like an 8km range, 4K video, and 35 minutes of flight time per battery. However, some users have reported issues with the gimbal, affecting stability during hyper-lapse shots. The Blackhawk 2 also has a less robust GPS system compared to DJI drones.

Exo Drones' partnership with Hubsan has led to speculation that the Blackhawk 2 is just a rebranded Hubsan Zero with a different design. The Hubsan Zino 2 is significantly cheaper than the Blackhawk 2 but offers similar features, such as 4K stills. The Blackhawk 2 has more intelligent flight modes than the Hubsan Zino 2.

Overall, Exo Drones is an exciting competitor in the drone market, offering affordable options with high-quality features. While DJI remains a dominant player, Exo Drones provides an alternative for those looking for a cheaper option. The company continues to improve and release new models, and it will be interesting to see what they offer in the future.
