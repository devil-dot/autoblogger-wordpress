In the midst of the quarantine, electrical engineer Cory found a way to keep the stress at bay by engaging in Nerf battles with his kids. However, he decided to take it up a notch by mounting a Nerf gun on a First Person View (FPV) drone. Cory had a few design goals in mind for his project - he wanted to create a flying Nerf gun that wouldn't permanently alter his Shendrones Squirt V2, and he wanted to be able to fire multiple Nerf darts using his existing RC link. To achieve this, he shared the files and Arduino code on hackaday for others to replicate.

To launch the darts, Cory used two motors from his previous quadcopter builds and controlled them with an Arduino Nano. These motors were powered by the drone's LiPo battery. While the exact mechanism is not clearly visible, it appears that Cory used a servo to push the darts between two rotating wheels, which then fling the darts towards the target. The accuracy of the Nerf gun seems fairly impressive, as Cory manages to score a crotch shot in his demonstration video.

Although the firing rate is not rapid-fire, with each dart taking approximately 2.5 seconds to fire and another five seconds before it's ready to fire again, the overall concept is entertaining. Cory uses BetaFlight to control the drone and provides more details about his build on his webpage.

The author of the article expresses their appreciation for Cory's lighthearted approach to drones, especially considering the numerous stories about deadly drones. They find it refreshing to see someone having fun with the concept of an attack drone. The author also expresses their curiosity about the perspective of the victim, hoping that Cory will share a video from their point of view as they experience the "spongy death from above."

In addition to summarizing Cory's project, the article briefly mentions the author's background. David MacQuarrie, the writer, is a veteran of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation with over 35 years of experience. He has worked in various locations and roles, including news writer, reporter, and producer for national and local television and radio networks. His stories on science and technology have received recognition and awards.

Overall, the article highlights Cory's innovative project of mounting a Nerf gun on an FPV drone. It emphasizes the lighthearted and entertaining nature of the concept, while also acknowledging the technical details and design considerations involved. The author's personal interest in the victim's perspective adds an element of curiosity and anticipation for potential future videos.

In this blog post, we learn about Cory, who found that having Nerf battles with his kids was a great way to blow off steam while working from home. However, he felt that he was getting too much exercise in the process and decided to come up with a solution. Cory equipped an FPV quadcopter with a 3D printed Nerf gun to take his place in the battles. 

To ensure that the Nerf gun could fire continuously without needing to be manually reloaded, Cory created an autoloader. He used a pair of brushless drone motors mounted side-by-side to propel the darts. The motors were allowed to spin up, and then a dart was loaded into a servo-operated plunger from an off-the-shelf Nerf magazine. An Arduino Nano controlled the motors' ESCs and servo, receiving the fire command from one of the spare outputs on the drone's flight controller. 

Cory also made sure that the Nerf gear could be easily removed from the drone so that he could use it for peaceful missions as well. He shared a video of one of the battles in the blog post, showcasing the capabilities of his modified drone. However, he did mention that he might need to find an alternative control location to prevent himself from being used as cover by his adversaries.

The blog post highlights the fun and harmless nature of Nerf guns and how they allow people to live out their sci-fi warfare fantasies. It mentions that with the technology available today, anything is possible, from FPV sentry guns to auto-aiming rifles and heavy artillery.

The blog post then takes a humorous turn, discussing how people with good intentions can justify atrocities without blinking and how people without a sarcasm filter can easily get offended. It mentions the joke of shooting people with red hats and suggests that it might be helpful for conservationists to use similar technology for tagging, sedating, and medicating animals.

The post also touches on the topic of sleep deprivation and how it is easier to achieve than operating a fully-fledged face recognition engine. It suggests that detecting a red hat is less resource-intensive and mentions the benefits of using lighter aircraft with better autonomy and longer reach.

The blog post includes some comments from readers, with one person jokingly asking for Cory's location. The post concludes by reminding readers to be kind and respectful in the comments section and mentions that the website uses cookies for performance, functionality, and advertising purposes.

Overall, the blog post provides an entertaining and informative account of Cory's creation of a Nerf drone for his at-home battles. It highlights the creativity and possibilities that technology offers in making everyday activities more enjoyable.
