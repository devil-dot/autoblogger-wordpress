In this online community dedicated to Nerf, BoomCo, and other foam blaster toys, a user named Wrenulater has gained attention for their recent project. They have upgraded the flywheel motors, pusher motor, and flywheel cage setup of a Nerf blaster to enhance its performance. Wrenulater is excited about the outcome of the project and is open to answering any questions about it.

The community members are impressed with Wrenulater's build process and the final result. They appreciate the inclusion of Nerf blasters in the project and express their admiration for Wrenulater's work. Some users suggest that Wrenulater should reach out to experienced modders to further improve the design.

One user mentions the "proton pack," a reference to a popular Nerf blaster, and asks if Wrenulater is familiar with it. Another user asks if there are any plans to revise the project in terms of better motors, wheels, and cage setups. The community members continue to praise Wrenulater's work and express their support.

A user jokingly mentions that while Wrenulater advises against attempting the project at home, they are still tempted to try it themselves. Another user shares their struggle with flying a drone, comparing it to their experience at a driving range where they struggle to hit the cart guy.

In the video showcasing the project, Wrenulater expresses concern about burning out the stock motors of the Nerf blaster. Another user recommends using Krakens, a type of motor, along with daybreak wheels and a daybreak stryfe cage from Thingiverse for better performance.

The community members appreciate the video and thank Wrenulater for not using elite darts, which are commonly used in Nerf blasters but are not favored by enthusiasts. The discussion ends on a positive note, with everyone expressing their admiration for Wrenulater's skills and creativity.

Overall, this online community is enthusiastic about Wrenulater's project and appreciates the effort put into upgrading a Nerf blaster. The members offer suggestions for further improvements and express their support for Wrenulater's work. The video showcasing the project is well-received, and the community members are grateful for the use of non-elite darts.

In the midst of the quarantine, electrical engineer Cory found a way to keep the stress at bay by engaging in Nerf battles with his kids. However, he decided to take it up a notch by mounting a Nerf gun on a First Person View (FPV) drone. Cory had a few design goals in mind for his project - he wanted to create a flying Nerf gun that wouldn't permanently alter his Shendrones Squirt V2, and he wanted to be able to fire multiple Nerf darts using his existing RC link. To achieve this, he shared the files and Arduino code on hackaday for others to replicate.

To launch the darts, Cory used two motors from his previous quadcopter builds and controlled them with an Arduino Nano. These motors were powered by the drone's LiPo battery. While the exact mechanism is not clearly visible, it appears that Cory used a servo to push the darts between two rotating wheels, which then fling the darts towards the target. The accuracy of the Nerf gun on the drone seems fairly impressive, as Cory manages to score a crotch shot in his video demonstration.

Although the firing rate is not rapid-fire, with each dart taking approximately 2.5 seconds to fire after the trigger is pulled, and another five seconds before it's ready to fire again, the overall concept is still entertaining. Cory controls the drone using BetaFlight, a popular software used for drone control. For more details on his build, he provides additional information on his build page.

The fact that Cory decided to experiment with the concept of an attack drone in a playful manner is a refreshing change from the usual stories we hear about deadly drones. His FPV video showcasing the Nerf drone in action is entertaining, but it would be even more interesting to see a video from the victim's perspective as they experience the spongy death raining down from above.

In conclusion, Cory's creation of a Nerf gun mounted on an FPV drone is a fun and innovative project that showcases his engineering skills and creativity. By sharing the files and code, he allows others to replicate his design and enjoy the excitement of Nerf battles from a whole new perspective. While the firing rate may not be as rapid as some may hope for, the accuracy and overall concept of the Nerf drone make it a unique addition to the world of remote-controlled toys. It's great to see someone exploring unconventional ideas and finding joy in the midst of challenging times.

In this blog post, we learn about Cory, who found that having Nerf battles with his kids was a great way to blow off steam while working from home. However, he felt that he was getting too much exercise in the process and decided to come up with a solution. Cory equipped an FPV quadcopter with a 3D printed Nerf gun to take his place in the battles. 

To ensure that the Nerf gun could fire continuously without needing to be manually reloaded, Cory created an autoloader. He used a pair of brushless drone motors mounted side-by-side to propel the darts. The motors were allowed to spin up, and then a dart was loaded into a servo-operated plunger from an off-the-shelf Nerf magazine. An Arduino Nano controlled the motors' ESCs and servo, receiving the fire command from one of the spare outputs on the drone's flight controller. 

Cory also made sure that the Nerf gear could be easily removed from the drone so that he could use it for peaceful missions as well. He shared a video of one of the battles in the blog post, showcasing the capabilities of his modified drone. However, he did mention that he might need to find an alternative control location to prevent himself from being used as cover by his adversaries.

The blog post highlights the fun and harmless nature of Nerf guns and how they allow people to live out their sci-fi warfare fantasies. It mentions that with the technology available today, anything is possible, from FPV sentry guns to auto-aiming rifles and heavy artillery.

The post also includes some unrelated comments and jokes, such as the mention of people justifying atrocities and the entertainment value of people without a sarcasm filter being offended. It briefly touches on conservationists potentially finding the modified Nerf drone helpful for tagging, sedating, and medicating animals. The author also mentions the possibility of using the drone to deliver vaccine inhalers, which have been in the news recently.

The blog post concludes with a mention of a similar video on YouTube and a comment from a reader named Wren Weichman, who expresses interest in knowing Cory's location. The post ends with a reminder to be kind and respectful in the comments section and a note about the use of cookies on the website.

Overall, the blog post provides an entertaining and informative account of Cory's creation of a Nerf drone for his at-home battles. It highlights the creativity and possibilities that technology offers in enhancing recreational activities.
