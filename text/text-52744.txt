One of the standout features of the EXO X7 Ranger Plus is its 360° collision avoidance system. By snapping on the EXO laser obstacle avoider, users can venture safely without having to worry about their surroundings. This feature allows users to focus more on flying and capturing stunning aerial shots.

Speaking of capturing shots, the EXO X7 Ranger Plus is equipped with a 2K video camera and a 1/3in camera sensor. This combination ensures that users can capture their best moments in impressive quality. Additionally, the drone features a 3-axis gimbal, which helps stabilize the camera and eliminate any unwanted vibrations or shakiness in the footage.

The EXO X7 Ranger Plus also offers a range of smart features that can be easily operated through the accompanying app. Users can adjust the camera angle, from birds-eye view to skyline shots, and even zoom in up to 50X digitally. The app also provides access to GPS location, virtual reality goggles, and much more, making it a comprehensive and user-friendly tool for drone enthusiasts.

In terms of flight capabilities, the EXO X7 Ranger Plus doesn't disappoint. It offers a sport mode that allows for speeds of up to 27MPH, with precise turning and smooth joystick control. The drone also features a unique centering function called X7 circles, which keeps the user centered for an epic blockbuster effect. Additionally, users can draw a box around themselves, and the drone will follow them, ensuring they stay centered throughout the flight. Alternatively, users can keep the remote with them, and the drone will follow their signal.

Safety is a top priority with the EXO X7 Ranger Plus. It offers a safety auto return feature that kicks in under three circumstances: when the user taps 'Return to Home,' when the drone loses connection, or when the battery gets too low. In any of these situations, the drone will automatically return to the takeoff point with just a tap, providing peace of mind to users.

The EXO X7 Ranger Plus is available for purchase at a price of $549. It comes with two batteries, ensuring extended flight time, and is available in a stylish USA Red color. However, if the price is a concern, customers can report a lower price they found, and while the company may not be able to match every reported price, they will use the feedback to ensure their prices remain competitive.

Customer reviews and star ratings are an essential aspect of any product, and the EXO X7 Ranger Plus is no exception. By reading customer reviews, potential buyers can learn more about the product and make an informed decision. The overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star are calculated based on the reviews, providing valuable insights into the product's quality and performance.

In conclusion, the EXO X7 Ranger Plus is a high-end camera drone that offers a range of impressive features.

With its safety auto return feature and competitive pricing, the EXO X7 Ranger Plus is a top choice for drone enthusiasts looking for a powerful and playful drone.

Exo Drones is a rapidly growing drone company that aims to fill the gap in the market between cheap drones and DJI's collection. The company was established around the same time DJI was added to the US Entity List due to concerns about data privacy. Exo Drones prides itself on not selling customer data and focuses on providing affordable, high-quality drones.

The CEO of Exo Drones, Charlie Canon, started the company after experiencing frustration with expensive DJI drones that had connectivity issues and lacked customer support. The mission of Exo Drones is to offer great customer service and bridge the gap in the drone market.

Exo Drones partnered with Hubsan, a drone manufacturer known for its hardware but lacking in software and customer support. This partnership allows Exo Drones to provide Hubsan with US backing and improve their customer support. Exo Drones later got acquired by OpenStore in August 2022.

One of Exo Drones' popular models is the Exo Mini Pro, which is comparable to DJI's Mini 3 Pro. The Exo Mini Pro offers an adjustable aperture, which is a feature usually found in professional photography drones. It also connects via USB instead of Wi-Fi, making it quicker to set up. The drone has obstacle avoidance and a 1/1.26" sensor, which is an improvement over DJI's Mini SE and Mini 2.

The Exo X7 Ranger Plus is another popular model from Exo Drones. It is priced around $300 and is comparable to drones like the HS720E, Ruko F11 Pro, and DJI Mini SE. The standout feature of the Exo Ranger drone is its 3 axial gimbal, which provides excellent image stability. It also has 4K resolution and similar flight times to other drones in its price range.

The Blackhawk 2 is another model from Exo Drones, which resembles the DJI Mavic Air in design but with better specs. It offers features like an 8km range, 4K video, and 35 minutes of flight time per battery. However, some users have reported issues with the gimbal, affecting stability during hyper-lapse shots. The GPS system is also not as robust as DJI's.

Exo Drones' partnership with Hubsan has led to speculation that the Blackhawk 2 is just a rebranded Hubsan Zero with a different design. The Hubsan Zino 2 is significantly cheaper than the Blackhawk 2 but offers similar features. The Blackhawk 2 has more intelligent flight modes, while the Zino 2 can take 4K stills.

Overall, Exo Drones is an exciting competitor in the drone market, offering affordable options with high-quality features. While DJI remains a dominant player, Exo Drones provides an alternative for those looking for a cheaper option. The company continues to improve and release new models, and it will be interesting to see what they have in store for the future.

In this blog post, the author discusses their experience with the Exo x7 drone and warns readers against purchasing it. The author initially researched the drone on various platforms, including a subreddit, but did not find any negative reviews. However, they express disappointment with the drone's performance, stating that the videos and pictures they captured were pixelated and of lower quality than advertised. They also criticize the drone's claim of 4K video capabilities, comparing it unfavorably to a cheap Android camera. The author believes that the Exo x7 is a rebranded version of the Beast drone, sold at a higher price. They strongly advise against buying the Exo x7 and suggest saving up for a DJI Mini instead.

The author's negative review is met with mixed responses from other users. One user, Ivan Vanko, disagrees with the author's assessment and claims to love their EXO drones, stating that they have had terrible experiences with DJI drones in the past. Another user expresses frustration with the company's marketing tactics, alleging that the drones are actually manufactured in China and India, despite being marketed as American-made. This user advises against buying the drone and mentions their intention to purchase a DJI Mini 2 instead.

Several users express gratitude for the author's honest review, stating that they were considering purchasing the Exo x7 but are now glad they did not. One user asks about the drone's origins, questioning whether it is a rebranded version of the CSJ x7. Another user thanks the author for their input, stating that they almost bought the Exo x7 but decided to do one more Google search and came across the negative reviews.

Another user, who has not purchased an EXO drone but has a DJI Mini 2, agrees with the author's assessment that there is a lack of independent reviews and actual specifications available for the Exo x7. They express gratitude for the honest input and state that the search for a drone continues, along with the search for accessories.

The author includes a personal anecdote from another user who had a similar experience with the company. This user claims that the company lied about being an American company and that the drones they received were not as advertised. They filed a complaint with their bank and won, refusing to pay for return fees and shipping to China.

Finally, the author shares their own negative experience with the Exo x7 Ranger Plus drone. They ordered it but received the wrong color, which they did not consider a deal breaker. However, they encountered issues with the controller, which did not turn on. After contacting customer service, they were sent a replacement controller that was heavily used and required AA batteries. This replacement controller was also dead on arrival. Frustrated, the author requested a return but had not received approval after 48 hours. They criticize the company's marketing claims of exceptional customer service and advise against doing business with ExoTech. They express regret for not purchasing the DJI Mini 2 instead, which they believe would have arrived quickly and offered better customer support.
