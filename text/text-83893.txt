With precise turning and smooth joystick control, users can navigate the drone with ease.

One of the standout features of the EXO X7 Ranger Plus is its ability to follow the user. Users can draw a box around themselves, and the drone will follow, keeping them centered the whole time. Alternatively, users can keep the remote with them, and the drone will follow via its signal. This feature is perfect for capturing action shots or creating dynamic videos.

For those who prefer a more hands-off approach, the EXO X7 Ranger Plus can also fly pre-determined routes. Users can set GPS points on their phone, and the drone will fly the route accordingly. When it's time to return, users can simply tap "Return to Home," and the drone will automatically return and land at the takeoff point. This safety feature ensures that users never have to worry about losing their drone or running out of battery.

In terms of pricing, the EXO X7 Ranger Plus is competitively priced at $549. This includes two batteries, allowing for extended flight time. However, if users are looking for additional features, there are other models available, such as the Mini Pro, Blackhawk 2 Pro, and Cinemaster 2, each with their own unique specifications and price points.

Exo Drones is a rapidly growing drone company that aims to fill the gap in the market between cheap drones and DJI's collection. The company was established around the same time DJI was added to the US Entity List due to concerns about data privacy. Exo Drones prides itself on not selling customer data and focuses on providing affordable, high-quality drones.

The CEO of Exo Drones, Charlie Canon, started the company after experiencing frustration with expensive DJI drones that had connectivity issues and lacked customer support. The mission of Exo Drones is to offer great customer service and bridge the gap in the drone market.

Exo Drones partnered with Hubsan, a drone manufacturer, to improve their software and customer support. This partnership allows Exo Drones to take over Hubsan's North American business and provide US backing for Hubsan's drones. Exo Drones was later acquired by OpenStore in August 2022.

One of Exo Drones' popular models is the Exo Mini Pro, which is comparable to DJI's Mini 3 Pro. The Exo Mini Pro offers an adjustable aperture, which is a feature usually found in professional photography drones. It also connects via USB, which makes it quicker to set up compared to DJI drones that use Wi-Fi. The Exo Mini Pro has obstacle avoidance and a 1/1.26" sensor, making it a competitive option in the market.

The Exo X7 Ranger Plus is another popular model from Exo Drones. It is priced around $300 and is comparable to drones like the HS720E, Ruko F11 Pro, and DJI Mini SE. The standout feature of the Exo X7 Ranger Plus is its 3 axial gimbal, which provides excellent image stability. It also offers 4K resolution and similar flight times to other drones in its price range.

The Blackhawk 2 is a drone from Exo Drones that resembles the DJI Mavic Air in design but with better specifications. It offers features like an 8km range, 4K video, and 35 minutes of flight time per battery. However, some users have reported issues with the gimbal, affecting stability during hyper-lapse shots. The Blackhawk 2 also has a less robust GPS system compared to DJI drones.

Exo Drones' partnership with Hubsan has led to speculation that the Blackhawk 2 is just a rebranded Hubsan Zero with a different design. The Hubsan Zino 2 is significantly cheaper than the Blackhawk 2 but offers similar features, such as 4K stills. The Blackhawk 2 has more intelligent flight modes than the Hubsan Zino 2.

Overall, Exo Drones is an exciting competitor in the drone market, offering affordable options with high-quality features. While DJI remains a dominant player, Exo Drones provides an alternative for those looking for a cheaper option. The company continues to improve and release new models, and it will be interesting to see what they offer in the future.
