However, some users have reported issues with the gimbal and GPS system.

Exo Drones has been criticized for being a cheaper alternative to DJI while offering similar features. However, the company continues to improve and release new models.

However, they express disappointment with the drone's performance, stating that the videos and pictures they captured were pixelated and of lower quality than advertised. They also criticize the drone's claim of shooting 4K video, comparing it unfavorably to a cheap Android camera. The author believes that the Exo x7 is a rebranded version of the Beast drone, which is marked up in price. They strongly advise against buying this drone and suggest saving up for a DJI Mini instead.

The author's negative review is met with mixed responses from other users. One user, Ivan Vanko, disagrees with the author's assessment and claims to love their EXO drones, stating that they have had terrible experiences with DJI drones in the past.

The replacement controller required AA batteries and was also dead on arrival. Frustrated, the author requested a return but had not received approval after 48 hours. They criticize the company's marketing claims of exceptional customer service and suggest that purchasing a DJI Mini 2 from Amazon would have been a better option.
