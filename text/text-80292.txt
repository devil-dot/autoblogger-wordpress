In the midst of the quarantine, electrical engineer Cory found a way to keep the stress at bay by engaging in Nerf battles with his kids. However, he decided to take it up a notch by mounting a Nerf gun on a First Person View (FPV) drone. Cory had a few design goals in mind for his project - he wanted to create a flying Nerf gun that wouldn't permanently alter his Shendrones Squirt V2, and he wanted to be able to fire multiple Nerf darts using his existing RC link. To achieve this, he posted the necessary files and Arduino code on hackaday for others to replicate.

To launch the darts, Cory used two motors from his previous quadcopter builds and controlled them with an Arduino Nano. These motors were powered by the drone's LiPo battery. While the exact mechanism is a bit difficult to see, it appears that Cory used a servo to push the darts between two rotating wheels. These wheels then fling the darts towards the intended target. The accuracy of the system seems fairly impressive, as Cory manages to score a crotch shot at the 0:16 mark in the accompanying FPV video.

Although the firing rate is not rapid-fire, with each dart taking approximately 2.5 seconds to fire after the trigger is pulled, and an additional five seconds before it's ready to fire again, the overall concept is still quite entertaining. Cory controls the drone using BetaFlight, a popular software used for drone control. For more details on his build, he provides additional information on his build page.

The fact that Cory decided to experiment with the concept of an attack drone in a playful manner is a refreshing change from the usual stories we hear about deadly drones. His FPV video showcasing the Nerf drone in action is entertaining, but it would be even more interesting to see a video from the victim's perspective as they experience the spongy death raining down from above.

In conclusion, Cory's project of mounting a Nerf gun on an FPV drone demonstrates his creativity and engineering skills. By sharing the files and code, he allows others to replicate his design and enjoy the fun of Nerf battles from a whole new perspective. It's a lighthearted and entertaining project that brings joy and excitement to both Cory and his kids during these challenging times.
