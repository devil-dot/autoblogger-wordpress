The SkyRocket drones are known for their use of ArduPilot as flight control software. This article provides information for advanced users and potential developers regarding these drones. However, it is important to note that the Journey drones sold by SkyRocket after the end of 2021 are not supported by ArduPilot.

In 2017, SkyRocket released the Sky Viper v2450GPS Drone with Autopilot and GPS, which is available for purchase through various retailers such as Walmart, Amazon, and Costco in multiple countries including the US, Australia, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Holland, Lithuania, Mexico, New Zealand, Serbia, and the UK.

In August 2018, SkyRocket introduced three new ArduPilot powered drones: the Fury, Scout, and Journey. The Fury and Scout drones utilize "SurfaceScan," a feature built on ArduPilot's OpticalFlow, which enables indoor flight stability and position holding at an unprecedented price range. On the other hand, the Journey drone, equipped with GPS instead of OpticalFlow, builds upon the lessons learned from the V2450GPS to provide a solid re-release with full GPS-enabled ArduPilot capabilities. The flight parameters and firmware of both the Scout and Journey drones can be easily modified by the user through the embedded wifi access point, powered by APWeb or any preferred ground control software. While much of the information on this page was initially written for the V2450GPS, it is still applicable to these new models, with updates provided as they are discovered.

In the present day, the Journey drone is no longer sold, and instead, the Sky Viper Journey SE is shipped. However, some resellers may still have the original Journey listed but have been observed to ship the Journey SE instead. For more information and discussions about SkyViper drones, interested individuals can visit the ArduPilot discussion forum dedicated to SkyViper.

The SkyViper drones come with Toy Mode set as the default. Toy Mode handles various functions specific to the Sky Viper 2450GPS, including button presses from the transmitter, automatic trimming of sticks when idle and disarmed, toggling the fence on and off based on GPS status, automatically switching between ALT_HOLD and LOITER modes depending on GPS status, managing LED bling, adjusting thrust based on voltage, performing an arming script to prevent sudden climbs, and conducting automatic compass tuning if necessary.

The SkyViper drones are equipped with an STM32 CPU, five serial ports, one I2C, one SPI, an ICM20789 IMU with a 3-axis accelerometer, gyro, and barometer, a Ublox M8 GPS, a 1S battery with a maximum voltage of 4.2V (replacement batteries readily available), brushed motors with a kV between 16,000 and 17,000, adjustable camera angle, 2.4Ghz wifi for telemetry and video streaming, a weight of 145g, a flight time of approximately 11 minutes, and a top speed ranging from 8m/s to 10m/s. The video streaming feature utilizes a Sonix board with an ARM CPU running FreeRTOS and an OmniVision OV9732 chip.

In conclusion, the SkyRocket drones, particularly the Sky Viper v2450GPS and its subsequent models, offer advanced features and capabilities through the use of ArduPilot as flight control software. With their GPS and autopilot functionalities, these drones provide stability, position holding, and an enhanced flying experience. The availability of firmware modifications and the active community on the ArduPilot discussion forum further contribute to the versatility and customization options for users and developers alike.
