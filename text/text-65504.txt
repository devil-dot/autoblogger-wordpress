In the world of Nerf, there is always excitement surrounding new modifications and inventions. One recent project that has caught the attention of the Nerf community is a nerf drone created by a user named Wrenulater. This innovative creation has sparked interest and discussion among enthusiasts.

Wrenulater's nerf drone has impressed many with its performance and design. The drone is equipped with flywheel motors, a pusher motor, and a flywheel cage setup that allows it to shoot foam darts at an impressive rate. The creator encourages others to upgrade these components to enhance the drone's capabilities even further.

The project has gained attention not only for its impressive features but also for the build process itself. Many users have expressed their enjoyment in watching the creation of the nerf drone, particularly when it incorporates nerf elements. The community has praised Wrenulater for his work and expressed their admiration for his skills.

One user even mentioned the proton pack, a popular gadget in the Nerf world. It seems that the nerf drone has sparked curiosity and discussion about other related inventions and modifications.

There is also speculation about potential future revisions to the nerf drone. Some users have suggested improvements such as better motors, wheels, and cage setups. It remains to be seen whether Wrenulater will make any changes to the stock cage assembly.

The nerf drone has garnered attention not only within the Nerf community but also from other modders. Users have encouraged Wrenulater to reach out to experienced modders who can provide valuable insights and help improve the design of the drone.

One user expressed their desire to see the nerf drone shoot more than 10 darts per second at a velocity of over 100fps. This demonstrates the high expectations and excitement surrounding this innovative creation.

Despite some concerns about safety, with one user cautioning against attempting to recreate the project at home, many users are eager to try it out for themselves. The nerf drone has inspired enthusiasts to explore their own modifications and inventions.

In terms of performance, there have been suggestions to use Krakens, a type of motor, as well as daybreak wheels and a daybreak stryfe cage from Thingiverse. These recommendations aim to enhance the drone's power and efficiency.

One aspect that users appreciated about the video showcasing the nerf drone was the choice of darts. Instead of using elite darts, which are commonly used in Nerf battles, Wrenulater opted for foam darts. This decision was well-received by the community, as it aligns with the spirit of the Nerf hobby.

Overall, the nerf drone created by Wrenulater has generated excitement and admiration within the Nerf community. Its impressive performance and unique design have captivated enthusiasts, sparking discussions about potential improvements and modifications. The project serves as a testament to the creativity and ingenuity of Nerf enthusiasts, who continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in the world of foam dart warfare.

In the midst of the quarantine, electrical engineer Cory found a way to keep the stress at bay by engaging in Nerf battles with his kids. However, he decided to take it up a notch by mounting a Nerf gun on a First Person View (FPV) drone. Cory had a few design goals in mind for his project - he wanted to create a flying Nerf gun that wouldn't permanently alter his Shendrones Squirt V2, and he wanted to be able to fire multiple Nerf darts using his existing RC link. To achieve this, he shared the files and Arduino code on hackaday for others to replicate.

To launch the darts, Cory used two motors from his previous quadcopter builds and controlled them with an Arduino Nano. These motors were powered by the drone's LiPo battery. While the exact mechanism is not clearly visible, it appears that Cory used a servo to push the darts between two rotating wheels, which then fling the darts towards the target. The accuracy of the Nerf gun on the drone seems fairly impressive, as Cory manages to score a crotch shot in his video demonstration.

Although the firing rate is not rapid-fire, with each dart taking approximately 2.5 seconds to fire after the trigger is pulled, and another five seconds before it's ready to fire again, the overall concept is still entertaining. Cory controls the drone using BetaFlight, a popular software used for drone control. For more details on his build, he provides additional information on his build page.

The fact that Cory decided to experiment with the concept of an attack drone in a playful manner is a refreshing change from the usual stories we hear about deadly drones. His FPV video showcasing the Nerf drone in action is entertaining, but it would be even more interesting to see a video from the victim's perspective as they experience the spongy death raining down from above.

In conclusion, Cory's project of mounting a Nerf gun on an FPV drone demonstrates his creativity and engineering skills. By sharing the files and code, he allows others to replicate his design and have some fun of their own. It's a lighthearted and enjoyable project that brings a new twist to the world of drones. As we continue to hear about the potential dangers and risks associated with drones, it's refreshing to see someone using them for harmless and entertaining purposes. Cory's project serves as a reminder that drones can be used for more than just surveillance or warfare, and can bring joy and laughter to people's lives.

In this blog post, we learn about Cory, who found that having Nerf battles with his kids was a great way to blow off steam while working from home. However, he felt that he was getting too much exercise in the process and decided to come up with a solution. Cory equipped an FPV quadcopter with a 3D printed Nerf gun to take his place in the battles. 

To ensure that the Nerf gun could fire continuously without needing to be manually reloaded, Cory created an autoloader. He used a pair of brushless drone motors mounted side-by-side to propel the darts. The motors were allowed to spin up, and then a dart was loaded into a servo-operated plunger from an off-the-shelf Nerf magazine. An Arduino Nano controlled the motors' ESCs and servo, receiving the fire command from one of the spare outputs on the drone's flight controller. 

Cory also made sure that the Nerf gear could be easily removed from the drone so that he could use it for peaceful missions as well. He shared a video of one of the battles in the blog post, showcasing the capabilities of his modified drone. However, he did mention that he might need to find an alternative control location to prevent himself from being used as cover by his adversaries.

The blog post highlights the fun and harmless nature of Nerf guns and how they allow people to live out their sci-fi warfare fantasies. It mentions that with the technology available today, anything is possible, from FPV sentry guns to auto-aiming rifles and heavy artillery.

The blog post then takes a humorous turn, discussing how people with good intentions can justify atrocities without blinking and how people without a sarcasm filter can easily get offended. It mentions the use of tagging, sedating, and medicating for conservation purposes but emphasizes that these actions should not be done to humans. The blog post also touches on the topic of sleep deprivation and how it is easier to detect a red hat than to operate a face recognition engine, leading to lighter aircraft and better autonomy.

The blog post includes some playful comments from readers, discussing shooting Nerf darts at people with red hats and the possibility of using a Nerf drone to deliver vaccine inhalers. It also mentions the idea of packing a Nerf dart in a Nerf-type envelope as a more socially acceptable alternative to a syringe to the face. The blog post concludes with a mention of a cool Nerf drone video and a link to another similar video.

Overall, the blog post showcases Cory's innovative solution to enjoying Nerf battles with his kids while working from home. It highlights the fun and harmless nature of Nerf guns and explores the possibilities of using technology to enhance the Nerf experience. The playful comments from readers add to the lighthearted tone of the blog post.
