Happy Viking Superfood is a brand of plant-based protein shakes that was developed by Venus Williams, a professional tennis player who was diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome in 2011. The syndrome causes inflammation, dry eye, and extreme fatigue, which forced Williams to withdraw from the U.S. Open that year. In order to improve her immune health and get back on the court, Williams started formulating her own superfood plant-based protein shakes in her kitchen with the help of nutritionists.

Williams found that adopting a plant-based diet and incorporating superfood nutrition into her daily routine had numerous benefits for her body, mind, and performance. She returned to the professional circuit the following year and went on to win a Wimbledon title and Olympic gold in doubles with her sister Serena Williams. By 2017, she was back in the top 5 rankings.

The core recipe for Happy Viking's plant-based shakes was inspired by Williams' whole-food regimen. The shakes are designed to be complete meals, containing 20g of protein, one cup of fruits and vegetables, one billion probiotics and prebiotics, over 60 superfoods, vitamins and minerals, ancient grains, electrolytes, DHA omega-3, quercetin, MCT oil, and fiber. The benefits listed on the packaging include sustained energy, lean muscle building, brain boosting power, immune support, collagen production, and digestive health.

The company has received support from a lineup of athlete investors, including Serena Williams, Michelle Wie West, Megan Rapinoe, Reilly Opelka, Isaiah Hertenstein, Collin Sexton, Kevin Durant, and Robin Arzón.
