Operating the EXO X7 Ranger Plus is a breeze thanks to its smart features. Users can easily access GPS location, virtual reality goggles, and much more from the app. This makes it convenient to control and monitor the drone's movements and settings.

When it comes to capturing high-quality footage, the EXO X7 Ranger Plus does not disappoint. It is equipped with a 2K video camera with a 1/3in camera sensor and a 3-axis gimbal. This combination ensures smooth and stable footage, even in challenging flying conditions. Additionally, the drone's 9MP photos allow users to capture their best moments in impressive quality, perfect for sharing with others.

For those looking for a more thrilling flying experience, the EXO X7 Ranger Plus offers a sport mode. In this mode, the drone can reach speeds of up to 27MPH, with precise turning and smooth joystick control. The drone's X7 feature also adds an epic blockbuster effect by circling the user, keeping them centered in the frame. Alternatively, users can draw a box around themselves, and the drone will follow their movements. Additionally, the drone can be controlled remotely or set to fly a predetermined route using GPS points on the user's phone.

Safety is a top priority with the EXO X7 Ranger Plus. It features a safety auto return function that ensures the drone returns to its takeoff point with just a tap. This feature is activated if the user taps 'Return to Home,' loses connection, or if the battery gets too low. This provides peace of mind and helps prevent the drone from getting lost or damaged.

Exo Drones is a rapidly growing drone company that aims to fill the gap in the market between cheap drones and DJI's collection. The company was established around the same time DJI was added to the US Entity List due to concerns about data privacy. Exo Drones prides itself on not selling customer data and focuses on providing affordable, high-quality drones.

The CEO of Exo Drones, Charlie Canon, started the company after experiencing frustration with expensive drones from DJI that had connectivity issues and lacked customer support. Exo Drones aims to offer better customer service and has partnered with Hubsan, a drone manufacturer known for its hardware but lacking in software and customer support. This partnership allows Exo Drones to take over Hubsan's North American business and provide US backing for Hubsan.

One of Exo Drones' popular models is the Exo Mini Pro, which is comparable to DJI's Mini 3 Pro. The Exo Mini Pro offers an adjustable aperture, a feature usually found in professional photography drones, and connects via USB for quicker setup. It also has obstacle avoidance and a higher-quality camera compared to DJI's Mini SE and Mini 2. The Exo Mini Pro is priced between the Mini 2 and Mini 3 Pro.

Another popular model is the Exo X7 Ranger Plus, which is comparable to drones like the HS720E, Ruko F11 Pro, and DJI Mini SE. The standout feature of the Exo X7 Ranger Plus is its 3 axial gimbal, which provides better image stability. The Blackhawk 2 is another model offered by Exo Drones, featuring intelligent flight modes and a 4K camera. However, some users have reported issues with the gimbal and GPS system.

In comparison to DJI's Mavic Air, the Blackhawk 2 offers similar features at a lower price point. The DJI Mavic Air has a larger sensor and higher photo resolution, but the Blackhawk 2 Pro has a 48MP camera to compete. The Mavic Air also has a greater range and more advanced technology.

Overall, Exo Drones is an exciting competitor in the drone market, offering affordable options with high-quality features. While DJI remains a dominant player, Exo Drones provides an alternative for those looking for a cheaper option. The company continues to improve and release new models, and it will be interesting to see what they offer in the future.
