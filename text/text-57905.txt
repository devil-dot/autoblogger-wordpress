The SkyRocket drones are known for their use of ArduPilot as flight control software. This provides advanced functionality for users and potential developers. However, it is important to note that the Journey drones sold by SkyRocket after 2021 are not supported by ArduPilot.

In 2017, SkyRocket released the Sky Viper v2450GPS Drone with Autopilot and GPS. This model is available for purchase through various retailers such as Walmart, Amazon, and Costco in multiple countries including the US, Australia, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Holland, Lithuania, Mexico, New Zealand, Serbia, and the UK.
