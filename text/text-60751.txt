In the midst of the quarantine, electrical engineer Cory found a way to keep the stress at bay by engaging in Nerf battles with his kids. However, he decided to take it up a notch by mounting a Nerf gun on a First Person View (FPV) drone. Cory had a few design goals in mind for his project - he wanted to create a flying Nerf gun that wouldn't permanently alter his Shendrones Squirt V2, and he wanted to be able to fire multiple Nerf darts using his existing RC link and 3D printed additional pieces.

Cory shared the files and Arduino code for his creation on hackaday, allowing others to replicate his design. To launch the darts, he utilized two motors from previous quadcopter builds and controlled them with an Arduino Nano. These motors were powered by the drone's LiPo battery. While the exact mechanism is not clearly visible, it appears that Cory used a servo to push the darts between two rotating wheels, which then fling the darts towards the target. The accuracy of the Nerf gun on the drone seems fairly impressive, as Cory manages to score a crotch shot in his video demonstration.

Although the firing rate is not rapid-fire, with each dart taking approximately 2.5 seconds to fire after the trigger is pulled, and an additional five seconds before it's ready to fire again, the overall concept is still entertaining. Cory controls the drone using BetaFlight, a popular software used for drone control. For more details on his build, he provides additional information on his build page.

The fact that Cory decided to experiment with the concept of an attack drone in a playful manner is a refreshing change from the usual stories we hear about deadly drones. His FPV video showcasing the Nerf drone in action is entertaining, but it would be even more interesting to see a video from the victim's perspective as they experience the spongy death raining down from above.

In conclusion, Cory's creation of a Nerf gun mounted on an FPV drone is a fun and innovative project that showcases his engineering skills and creativity. By sharing the files and code, he allows others to replicate his design and enjoy the excitement of Nerf battles from a whole new perspective. It's a lighthearted and entertaining take on the concept of attack drones, providing a welcome break from the usual serious discussions surrounding drones.

In this blog post, we learn about Cory, a father who enjoys spending time with his kids but wanted to find a way to engage in Nerf battles without exerting too much physical effort. To solve this problem, Cory decided to equip an FPV quadcopter with a 3D printed Nerf gun. However, he needed to create an autoloader for the gun since manually reloading after every shot was not feasible.

Cory's autoloader design involves using a pair of brushless drone motors mounted side-by-side to propel the darts. The motors are allowed to spin up, and then a dart is loaded into a servo-operated plunger from an off-the-shelf Nerf magazine. The Arduino Nano controls the motors' ESCs and servo, receiving the fire command from one of the spare outputs on the drone's flight controller. This setup allows Cory to remotely control the firing of the Nerf gun from the drone.

The Nerf gear is easily removable from the drone, allowing Cory to use the drone for other purposes as well. He shares a video of one of the battles in the blog post, showcasing the functionality of his modified drone. However, Cory realizes that he may need to find an alternative control location to prevent himself from being used as cover by his opponents during the battles.

The blog post also mentions that Nerf guns are a fun and harmless way to live out sci-fi warfare fantasies, especially with the technology available today. It highlights the various advancements in Nerf-related technology, such as FPV sentry guns, auto-aiming rifles, and heavy artillery.

The blog post then takes a humorous turn, discussing how people with good intentions can sometimes justify atrocities without blinking. It mentions the entertainment value of seeing people without a sarcasm filter getting offended by jokes. The author also brings up the idea of using Nerf guns for conservation purposes, such as tagging, sedating, or medicating animals.

The post briefly touches on the topic of sleep deprivation and how it can be achieved more easily by detecting a red hat rather than operating a face recognition engine. This leads to a mention of the benefits of using a lighter aircraft with better autonomy and longer reach, without the need for a costly Nvidia Jetson.

The author then includes some lighthearted comments from readers, discussing the possibility of using the Nerf drone to deliver vaccine inhalers or using a Nerf dart to gently remind people to wear masks properly. The blog post concludes with a comment about the coolness of the Nerf drone and a link to a similar video.

Overall, the blog post provides an entertaining and informative account of Cory's creation of a Nerf drone and explores the fun and creative possibilities of Nerf-related technology.
