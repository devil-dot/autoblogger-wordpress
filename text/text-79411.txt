The Sky Viper drone, manufactured by SkyRocket, is a popular choice among drone enthusiasts. This drone utilizes ArduPilot as its flight control software, providing advanced features and capabilities for users. However, it is important to note that the Journey drones sold by SkyRocket after 2021 are not supported by ArduPilot.

In 2017, SkyRocket released the Sky Viper v2450GPS Drone with Autopilot and GPS. This model is available for purchase through various retailers such as Walmart, Amazon, and Costco in multiple countries including the US, Australia, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Holland, Lithuania, Mexico, New Zealand, Serbia, and the UK. Among the 2017 models, only the V2450GPS Streaming drone, which features a white shell, is compatible with ArduPilot.

In August 2018, SkyRocket introduced three new ArduPilot powered drones: the Fury, Scout, and Journey. The Fury and Scout drones utilize a feature called "SurfaceScan," which is built on ArduPilot's OpticalFlow technology. This allows for indoor flight stability and position holding, which is unprecedented in this price range. The Journey drone, on the other hand, incorporates GPS instead of OpticalFlow, building on the lessons learned from the V2450GPS model to provide a solid GPS-enabled ArduPilot experience. Users have the flexibility to modify the flight parameters and firmware of both the Scout and Journey drones through the embedded wifi access point, powered by APWeb or their preferred ground control software.

While much of the information provided on the Sky Viper v2450GPS model is applicable to the 2018 models, updates will be annotated as they are discovered. It is worth noting that the Journey model is no longer sold, and instead, the Sky Viper Journey SE is shipped. Resellers may still have the Journey listed but have been observed to ship the Journey SE instead.

Additionally, the developer wiki provides more specific information on compiling the sonix and ardupilot firmware.

The Sky Viper drone comes with Toy Mode set as the default. Toy Mode offers various functions specific to the Sky Viper 2450GPS model. It handles button presses from the transmitter, automatically trims the sticks when they are idle and the drone is disarmed, toggles the fence on and off based on GPS status, and adjusts the thrust based on voltage. Toy Mode also performs an arming script when armed using the throttle control to prevent sudden climbs by idling the motors for a moment before increasing speed. Furthermore, it performs automatic compass tuning if necessary.

In terms of specifications, the Sky Viper drone features an STM32 CPU, five serial ports, one I2C, and one SPI. It is equipped with an ICM20789 IMU, which includes a 3-axis accelerometer, gyro, and barometer. The drone utilizes a Ublox M8 GPS and a 1S battery with a maximum voltage of 4.2V. Replacement batteries for the drone are readily available on platforms like Amazon. The drone is powered by brushed motors with a kV between 16,000 and 17,000. It has a gear ratio of approximately 5.6, with a small pinion of 13T and a larger one of 73T. The camera on the drone can be manually adjusted to point forward, downward, or anywhere in between. It operates on a 2.4GHz wifi frequency for telemetry and video transmission. The drone weighs 145g and has a flight time of approximately 11 minutes. Its top speed ranges between 8m/s to 10m/s. The video streaming capabilities of the drone utilize a Sonix board with an ARM CPU running FreeRTOS and an OmniVision OV9732 chip.
