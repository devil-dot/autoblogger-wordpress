In this blog post, the author discusses their experience with the Sky Viper 670 Stunt Drone. They were initially intrigued by an ad for the drone and decided to order it for $50 USD. The drone arrived quickly from Amazon, and the author provides a detailed review of its features, set up, and flying experience.

The Sky Viper 670 Stunt Drone is described as one of the sexiest drones the author has ever seen, with a modern and edgy green and black color scheme. The drone is made of a solid and durable material, and its shape is compared to that of a spider about to pounce. It has navigation lights in the form of LEDs and the ability to flip and do barrel rolls, which is a unique feature. Unlike most drones that come with only one battery, the Sky Viper 670 Stunt Drone comes with two batteries. It also has three flight modes, allowing users to select the right level of control for their experience level.

The author praises the quality of build of the drone, considering its price of $50. It features a tough duraflex airframe that is strong, light, and resistant to breaking. The remote control is also of high quality for a drone in this price range. The body style and color are attractive and well-designed. The drone has different color blades in the front and rear, making it easier to orient during flight. It also comes with removable prop guards and a spare battery, giving it a higher class feel compared to other drones in its price range.

The Sky Viper 670 Stunt Drone comes ready to fly, with the only challenge being removing the battery to put it on the charger. The author mentions that it took them some time to figure out how to remove the battery due to the design of the battery cage. They recommend using the prop guards for absolute beginners or flying in tight spaces, but suggest removing them for a faster and more responsive flight experience.

The drone has three flight modes: beginner, advanced, and expert. The beginner mode is stable with slow responses to control inputs, making it suitable for learning or flying indoors. The advanced mode is more responsive and stable, while the expert mode is aggressive and works well in windy conditions. The drone can perform flips, but the recovery from flips with the prop guards on is not great. Without the prop guards, it can perform flips at a low altitude without hitting the ground. The drone's highlight is its ability to do barrel rolls, which the author describes as a sideways flip while flying forward or backward.

The author recommends the Sky Viper 670 Stunt Drone for both indoor and outdoor flight. They suggest using the prop guards indoors to practice important piloting skills, such as flying away from and towards the pilot. The drone's yaw control is responsive, making it a great quad to practice using the left stick control. Overall, the author had a positive experience with the drone and encourages others to consider it for their flying adventures.
