In the midst of the quarantine, electrical engineer Cory found a way to keep the stress at bay by engaging in Nerf battles with his kids. However, he decided to take it up a notch by mounting a Nerf gun on a First Person View (FPV) drone. Cory had a few design goals in mind for his project - he wanted to create a flying Nerf gun that wouldn't permanently alter his Shendrones Squirt V2, and he wanted to be able to fire multiple Nerf darts using his existing RC link. To achieve this, he shared the files and Arduino code on hackaday for others to replicate.

To launch the darts, Cory used two motors from his previous quadcopter builds and controlled them with an Arduino Nano. These motors were powered by the drone's LiPo battery. While the exact mechanism is not clearly visible, it appears that Cory used a servo to push the darts between two rotating wheels, which then fling the darts towards the target. The accuracy of the Nerf drone seems fairly impressive, as Cory manages to score a crotch shot in his demonstration video.

Although the firing rate is not rapid-fire, with each dart taking approximately 2.5 seconds to fire and another five seconds before it's ready to fire again, the overall concept of a Nerf drone is entertaining. Cory uses BetaFlight to control the drone and has provided more details about his build on his webpage.

The author of the article expresses their appreciation for Cory's lighthearted approach to drones, especially considering the numerous stories about deadly drones. They find it refreshing to see someone having fun with the concept of an attack drone. The author also expresses their curiosity about the victim's perspective and hopes that Cory will share a video showing the drone's spongy death from above.

In terms of the author's background, they mention that David MacQuarrie, the writer of the article, is a veteran of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation with over 35 years of experience. He has worked in various locations and held roles such as news writer, reporter, and producer for national and local television and radio networks. His stories on science and technology have won ACTRA and Columbus awards.

Overall, the article highlights Cory's innovative project of creating a Nerf drone and shares the details of his design and build process. The author appreciates the lightheartedness of the project and expresses their interest in seeing the drone's impact from the victim's perspective.
